<h3>
Kick-off agenda
</h3>
<p>FinTech comprises a variety of products, applications, processes and business models that have transformed the traditional way of providing banking and financial services, which can be of great benefit to the Czech society (e.g. mobile/contactless payments and cross-border remittances; e-banking services; FinTech-assisted credit intermediation to SMEs and other financial services distributed by P2P or other FinTech platforms; crypto-assets and other distributed ledger technologies (DLT) -based financial applications; artificial intelligence-based systems and machine learning models using big data for credit underwriting, algorithmic trading, asset management and other financial market applications).
FinTech can improve the efficiency of the financial sector, all the more so in the context of the digitalisation trend that was intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic. Modern technologies and the advantages of the Czech IT sector (technical capacities, skills) are not used to their full potential, and there is currently no innovation facilitator dedicated to financial technologies and data. The absence of legal certainty in the FinTech sector may hinder its full development, which could allow a greater use of digital services and thus enhance the growth potential of such markets.
Further promotion of FinTech innovation has the potential to provide important benefits to the Czech economy. Financial technologies can improve the efficiency of the financial system and deepen capital markets, drive productivity gains, promote competition in the financial services sector, and ultimately benefit small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) and financial consumers, while also advancing financial inclusion by allowing access to financial services for underserved and underbanked customers. The associated risks should be taken into careful consideration for each of the above, so that the potential of FinTech and data is unlocked while consumer protection, market integrity, and financial stability are ensured.
The project is highly linked to Chapter 1.4 of the Czech National Recovery and Resilience Plan which is focused on digital technologies and aims at creating sandboxes in regulated sectors in line with EU priorities.</p>
